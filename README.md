# Twilio Mock Server

Twilio Mock Server is a lightweight mock implementation of Twilio APIs, designed for local development and testing. It leverages [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) to simulate Twilio endpoints, so you can build and test your integrations without sending real requests to Twilio.

> Why does this project exist?  
> Because Twilio doesn't provide a sandbox environmentâ€”so I made my own! (If Twilio ever does, I'll finally get some sleep.)
